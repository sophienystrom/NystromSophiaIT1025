# Executive summary
Type your executive summary as if you were explaining your lab on an IT team

Lab 1 of week one in Information Technologies for Computer Programers focuses on the beginning of basic system components and an introduction to our main cloud-computing site of Github. Setting up an account, learning the markdown language of the application (such as how to bullet point), and exploring the page in general are main components of this lesson. Also, properly being able to navigate around the true main class information site (blackboard) will also be explored by means of doument attachment. Overall the main focuses are as follows: Github basic setup and startup, blackboard navigation, basic systems and their processes, and relating these processes to applications. 


# Information System Componentsâ€¯ 

* Take the example of ATM that we use everyday. Explain or identify what is the hardware, software, data, people and process in the system you identified with respect to the ATM.

ATMS or automated teller machines are used all over the world to manage money convenietly for clients. To do this the ATM must have input devices for authenticating information (such as a keypad for putting in a pin number, or a card reader to capture stored account infortmation). ATMS do not work without a factor of authenticity by the client, which would be a credit card or apple pay scan by the machine. The need for a factor like that goes to show the software integrity of the ATM. The heart and core of the ATMs working is its microprocessor and sort of works in a client-server architecture by which I mean most ATMS conect to one database as clients, communicating with the host processor for the retrieval and sharing of the information they are looking for. To the naked eye an ATM seems to be a fairly easy to use machine, but when you look at the different components that makes it work you will notice how beautifully complex the system truly is. 
# Github

* In GitHub you are experiencing a "Client-Server" architecture.  Explain what is meant by "client-server" architecture and how GitHub fits this model. 

Client-server architecture is a networking setup that allows a "client" to connect to a "server" as a way to share information and resources. Github fits this specific architecture because github allows multiple "clients" to share the same files or have permissions to access and edit a specific document, just like how I am sharing this file with my professor. Github hosts and manages all resources that us, the clients, use. This therefore makes Github technically fit into the client-server architectural model.

* Why is GitHub considered "Cloud Computing?" What other "cloud computing" environments do you use?

Cloud computing is a mobile version of system resources and storage. Github is technically considered cloud computing since it is generally able to be accessed by anyone, anywhere over internet. The large easy readiness of github as a site makes it a "mobile version of system resources", and therefore a good example of cloud computing. More examples of cloud computing environments would be the group of Google applications such as google documents or google slides. These applications count as cloud computing for the same reasons that github does, except that many google applications are also available without internet, making it's storage accessiblity even better.


# Conclusion
In this section you might discuss future considerations (what you might want to learn more about), issues that you encountered (remember you may decide to post your repo link on LinkedIn or provide to a future employer so be sure to keep your discussion professional) and/or your impressions of the lab components.

The introduction to different processes was truly intriguing. Being basically completely new to computer science I can say with 100% assurance that I learned information from this lab that will stay with me my whole life. Personally, I am excited to get more into system processes and seeing how they apply to the machines and technology that I use everyday. On top of that I generally have been exploring github and getting used to the IT1025 class setup, it will be nice to get used to the formatting and layout of these two important pages. Small problems were faced while trying to correctly create the readme file and the TEST1 folder, but I am sure that I have figured it out. By the end of this lab I was able to relate what I have learned to the everyday technology I experience in everday life.
