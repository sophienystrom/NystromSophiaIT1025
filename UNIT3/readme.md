# Executive Summary
* Write up as though you are explaining this week's lab to others.

Our third lab in IT for programmers takes the first real step into the world of IT. In the past two labs we have dived into the hardware of computers, how they work, and our basic class github setup. This week we are focusing on computer softwares, basic syntax coding, and different careers that this introductory course can lead us to. The largest part of this lab is the exploration aspect. We will be looking at multiple paths that we are looking into for our own futures, and what those career paths entail. On another hand this lab includes researching further into the stepping stones to those future careers by having us look at certificates and programs that can enhance our computer science knowledge, and therefore our futures in IT. The intro to python coding is a special part of this lab, since most have not looked at the coding system before. In short, lab 3 of IT for programmers will expand our knowledge on the career field while further helping us learn about important topics at the same time.

# Software
* Explain the roles of application, utility and operating system software. Give an example of each.

Application software plays out specific functions (educational, personal, etc) designed to assist a user with a process. A few examples of application software are Microsoft products like Excel, Word, and Powerpoint. Safari and Chrome also count as application software. 
Operating systems software very basically manages hardware resources of a computer and acts as the connection between the user and that hardware. Having an operating system is part of the very basics on how devices run. Examples of operating systems include: Chrome OS, IOS, or Windows. 
Utility software is a group of programs that allow a user to make modifications to their computer. Utility software is usually included with operating system packages to fill in gaps. A few examples are antivirus softwares, disk cleaners or repairs, and data security. 

* Explain the purpose of ERP software and provide an example.

ERP software's purpose is to very simply store all information in a central database that is available to all programs. It is a type of business management software that allows a company to manage themselves and automate business productions. A few examples of ERP softwares are Oracle ERP Cloud, Acumatica Cloud ERP, and BizAutomation. ERP itself stands for "Enterprise Resource Planning", which kind of outputs its own definition it it's name. 

* Explain the purpose of virtualization and describe how it differs from cloud computing.

Virtualization is stimulation of hardware functionality to created virtual comptuer systems from the help of software. Virtualization allows there to be more than one virtual system with multiple operating systems, which in the long run is much more efficient than if it didn't exist. Cloud computing differs from virtualization because cloud computing bases on storing transformed data. So the main difference here would be that virtualization separates physical hardware from computing environments and cloud computing would store the information that is created by that. 

# Python
* Follow the tasks for pythong coding. Then upload screenshot of python code (named Python) and output to this folder

# Virtualization
* What types of problems are solved with virtualization?

There are a handful of problems that virtualization solves. One problem (that may not be seen as a problem) is the reduced operating costs that entail with virtualization. Another problem solves is that more than one operating system can be ran on a machine incorporated with virtualization. Being able to have more than one OS then makes the computer more efficient which in turn reduces the operating costs. The problems virtualization solves fix eachother to make computing better. 

* What role does hypervisor play in virtualization?

Hypervirsor is a computer software/hardware that runs virtual machines created by virtualization. Basically, hypervisor allows you to host multiple virtual machines and have them work efficiently. The software/hardware allows each virtualization system to run their own program and also allows a user to access more than one system. 

# Career Exploration
## Career Exploration
* Tri-C College Central:
* Register for a student account.
Use one of the search options such as "Search - Intern Central," take a screenshot of the listings (include your name in the upper right-hand corner in your screenshot,) name the file: CollegeCentral and upload to your lab folder.
* Bureau of Labor Statistics
Go to: Bureau of Labor Statistics website and continue exploring careers in IT (or your area of interest.) You can search for "web developer" or "network" or "cyber" and see what jobs appear. Report your findings including job title, salary and projected growth. You can upload a screenshot if you want.
# Industry Certification
* Explore a certification and report your findings. (CompTIA , Cisco , CISSP or any other certification)
# College Certificates
* Explore the Tri-C certificates at: Tri-C IT Programs and report on a certificate of interest (short-term or post-degree.)
* Explain what you need to do to become co-op "ready" and the benefits of pursuing a co-op or internship
# Professional Membership
* Pick one of the IT organizations like IEEE or ACM or a student club and report the purpose of the organization and why membership would be beneficial.

# Conclusion
* Summary of your understanding from this week's lab
