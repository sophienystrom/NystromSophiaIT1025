# Executive Summary
* Write up as though you are explaining this week's lab to others.

Our third lab in IT for programmers takes the first real step into the world of IT. In the past two labs we have dived into the hardware of computers, how they work, and our basic class github setup. This week we are focusing on computer softwares, basic syntax coding, and different careers that this introductory course can lead us to. The largest part of this lab is the exploration aspect. We will be looking at multiple paths that we are looking into for our own futures, and what those career paths entail. On another hand this lab includes researching further into the stepping stones to those future careers by having us look at certificates and programs that can enhance our computer science knowledge, and therefore our futures in IT. The intro to python coding is a special part of this lab, since most have not looked at the coding system before. In short, lab 3 of IT for programmers will expand our knowledge on the career field while further helping us learn about important topics at the same time.

# Software
* Explain the roles of application, utility and operating system software. Give an example of each.

Application software plays out specific functions (educational, personal, etc) designed to assist a user with a process. A few examples of application software are Microsoft products like Excel, Word, and Powerpoint. Safari and Chrome also count as application software. 
Operating systems software very basically manages hardware resources of a computer and acts as the connection between the user and that hardware. Having an operating system is part of the very basics on how devices run. Examples of operating systems include: Chrome OS, IOS, or Windows. 
Utility software is a group of programs that allow a user to make modifications to their computer. Utility software is usually included with operating system packages to fill in gaps. A few examples are antivirus softwares, disk cleaners or repairs, and data security. 

* Explain the purpose of ERP software and provide an example.

ERP software's purpose is to very simply store all information in a central database that is available to all programs. It is a type of business management software that allows a company to manage themselves and automate business productions. A few examples of ERP softwares are Oracle ERP Cloud, Acumatica Cloud ERP, and BizAutomation. ERP itself stands for "Enterprise Resource Planning", which kind of outputs its own definition it it's name. 

* Explain the purpose of virtualization and describe how it differs from cloud computing.

Virtualization is stimulation of hardware functionality to created virtual comptuer systems from the help of software. Virtualization allows there to be more than one virtual system with multiple operating systems, which in the long run is much more efficient than if it didn't exist. Cloud computing differs from virtualization because cloud computing bases on storing transformed data. So the main difference here would be that virtualization separates physical hardware from computing environments and cloud computing would store the information that is created by that. 

# Python
* Follow the tasks for pythong coding. Then upload screenshot of python code (named Python) and output to this folder

# Virtualization
* What types of problems are solved with virtualization?

There are a handful of problems that virtualization solves. One problem (that may not be seen as a problem) is the reduced operating costs that entail with virtualization. Another problem solves is that more than one operating system can be ran on a machine incorporated with virtualization. Being able to have more than one OS then makes the computer more efficient which in turn reduces the operating costs. The problems virtualization solves fix eachother to make computing better. 

* What role does hypervisor play in virtualization?

Hypervirsor is a computer software/hardware that runs virtual machines created by virtualization. Basically, hypervisor allows you to host multiple virtual machines and have them work efficiently. The software/hardware allows each virtualization system to run their own program and also allows a user to access more than one system. 

# Career Exploration
## Career Exploration
* Tri-C College Central:
* Register for a student account.
Use one of the search options such as "Search - Intern Central," take a screenshot of the listings (include your name in the upper right-hand corner in your screenshot,) name the file: CollegeCentral and upload to your lab folder.

Snippet uploaded.

* Bureau of Labor Statistics
Go to: Bureau of Labor Statistics website and continue exploring careers in IT (or your area of interest.) You can search for "web developer" or "network" or "cyber" and see what jobs appear. Report your findings including job title, salary and projected growth. You can upload a screenshot if you want.

The career that I chose to explore was a Software Developer. 
Software developers create applications that run on computers or other technological devices. Most software developers work for computer systems firms, but some developers can freelance and create private softwares. Usually to become a developer one has to have the minimum of a bachelor's degree in computer science, with a lot of experience and skill working with computers themselves. Computer programming skills are basically the basis of the job and being fluent in multiple languages will aid in the career field. Currently, the job outlook for software developers is very high, 21% faster than average growth. As technology grows bigger and bigger, new and better programming skills are needed to keep up with the industry. This means software development may always be on the rise. The average salary for a developer is about $105,000 a year, with the lowest 10% earning $60,000 a year and the highest 10% earning around $160,000 a year. Similar occupations include computer research scientists, IT managers, and computer hardware engineers. 

# Industry Certification
* Explore a certification and report your findings. (CompTIA , Cisco , CISSP or any other certification)

CISCO certifications push into very many dynamics of IT technologies. There are multiple certifications you can get depending on what you want your professional career to look like. For example, you can opt for the associate certification standards and gain the knowledge needed to boost a career as a network designer and professional or you can go for the highest architect certification and get a full round-a-bout of network designing (a true master of the art). I chose the associates CCNA certification course. In this course you get prepared for a career in IT and all you have to do is pass one exam that covers IT's fundamental principles. The certification goes over networking technologies, software development, job roles, Cyber Ops, cloud collaboration, security, and much much more. There are webinars, study groups, and training programs to aid in the way. If I were to get a quick certification to aid in my future in the IT field (on top of a degree) I would choose the CCNA certification since it is a nice add-on and is perfect for people who are new to the field and need a mild add-on to their computer knowledge. 

# College Certificates
* Explore the Tri-C certificates at: Tri-C IT Programs and report on a certificate of interest (short-term or post-degree.)

While searching the different certificate opportunities Tri-c offered I realized how hard of a choice it was to choose between the various computer science type courses. Tri-C has a range of Cisco certifications, like the one I mentioned above, but although the CCNA is quite interesting I would not choose the certificate over a few others. THe first degree that caught my eye was the Information Technology- Programmin and Development Associate of Applied Business. This specific course gives one the experience they need to: Communicate and present skills, operate in a team environment, apply models and procedures to efficiate IT resources, apply programmind and website maintance knowledge to develop/test/qualify technological business systems, etc. Looking at the suggested sequence the degree goes over a range of topics in both business and IT, which in the future will work together to be efficient in a job. The whole degree itself is a total of 60 credit hours, and seems to be generally completed over the course of four semesters. Electives for degree are IT based and are very nice add ons to the already rigorous course to be learned. 

* Explain what you need to do to become co-op "ready" and the benefits of pursuing a co-op or internship

A cooperative education (or co-op) provides students with a high edge by helping them get hands-on experience in a career field of their choice. This will provide insight to that student's career path and future job opportunities. Tri-C's cooperative education experienes have their own eligibility requirements. To become co-op ready you must (basically) have gone through 12 hours of college coursework, be enrolled, and have a GPA over 2.75. Students must also complete and application of interest, go to an orientation process, and upload a resume. Cooperative education are beneficial since they provide academic credit by the means of a job experience. You will not only be receiving hands on knowledge in your career field of choice, therefore HIGLY expanding your knowledge and qualifications, but you will recieve credits towards your degree at the same time. 

# Professional Membership
* Pick one of the IT organizations like IEEE or ACM or a student club and report the purpose of the organization and why membership would be beneficial.

The ACM IT organization (Association of Computer Machinery) brings together computer scientists, researchers, IT professionals, and educators around the world to address discreptancies and challenges in the field of IT and related paths. Membership in the career strengthens ones profession's collective voice due to strong leading and the organization recognizes technical excellence. Professional growth of memebers is strived for and many opportunities are provided for the long run in career development. 

# Conclusion
* Summary of your understanding from this week's lab

During this lab I learned the different aspects and importances of software in computing, basics of python as a programming language, and the variety of careers related to IT that may be foresworn in my future. It was very interesting to learn about the introductions of python coding, and I am excited myself to continue that knowledge and further learn about the applications of python and how becoming fluent can progress my future. I especially like the career exploration part of this lab since I am usually a very unsure person about which career path I look to pursuing. It was interesting to see so many different certifications that could boost a resume if sought after, and I believe in my near future as I graduate high school that I will take advantage of the opportunity to plan to gain them.
