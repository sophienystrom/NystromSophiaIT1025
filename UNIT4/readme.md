# Executive Summary
* Update this section for this lab explaining the purpose of the lab

In this week's lab our class is utilizing past lab knowledge for tasks. We are also diving into graphics and graphics design, focusing on different aspects of graphics and the varieties of image files (png, jpg, etc). Last week's lab is also making a comeback with the incorporation of further details into operating systems, specifically windows and mac. An especially interesting task for this week is to create a logo image that has multiple layers of graphics. Simply: we will be learning about different factors in graphics and imaging, further gaining knowledge about operating systems, and then using what we have learned about graphics to create and design a logo.

# Graphics
## Raster vs. Vector Graphics
* Explain the difference between a raster and vector image.
Include examples of when each would be most appropriate

A raster image is an image formed by a variety of pixels and colors that create an image. A vector imagine is an image composed of paths and lines that are mathematically created. The biggest difference between the two is that when zooming into a raster image you will see the independent pixelation but when zooming into a vector image the lines will always be smooth and clear. Vector graphics are used a lot for logos and fonts so they can be printed at any size and still be legible and raster graphics can be applicated to clipart and images that do not have lines.

## Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
* Why does it matter to developers whether they use lossless or lossy image formats?

To start the answer off, the lossless image format can reduce an images size without losing any of the quality of the original image while the lossy image format results in the loss of both data and quality from the OG version of the image. This matters to developers because no one wants to save an image file and have it turn out to be very pixelated and jagged because they chose a lossy format. The reductions by lossy formats are permanent, but if you use a lossy format your files will technically be smaller, which is a plus. 

## File Formats
* Explain the similarities and differences between jpg, gif and png files.

A JPG file format is a type of lossy compression that can go all the way to 1/10th of an images original size without any true noticiable differences in the actual quality of the image. JPGs are suited good for natural photos and not images with huge contrasts since with lossy compressions the pixels cannot be averaged out.
A GIF file format is a verson of lossless compression that doesn't degrade the image quality. GIF's are not preferred over other lossless formatting like PNG files since GIF's have up to 25% worse compression quality. GIFs are useful for imaged short video animations. 
A PNG file is also a form of lossless compression that doesn't lose any data during compression. PNGs also don't introduce compression artefacts so the actual image quality is high and it looks very sharp. PNGs occupy a lot of disk space so they are suitable for high resolution photographs (logos, shapes, edges).
Regarding transparency JPEG files are different from PNG and GIF since JPG doesn't support transparency. PNG and GIF files do, PNG in two different ways and GIF in one. PNG insert alpha channels that allow partial transparency and they olso use idex transperancy. GIF images declare a signle color palette transparent and uses dithering, but GIF is still unsuitable for transparent backgrounds. 
Color wise JPG files have about 16 million colors while PNG and GIF are limited to around 256 colors.


# Operating Systems 
* Upload screenshots for Operating System tasks to github

# Logo
* Upload your logo image that you created from the Graphics Tasks
* Explain your image design including how many "layers" were required

The image I attempted to create was the flower image from our tutorial video. My image required 17 different layers, most of which were petals. To begin my image I created a simple circle and changed the color to a floral center. Then I used the pen tool to create a kite shape and then double clicked and evened out the corners to create a petal look. Then I copied and pasted the petals all around the circle center and changed the color to a light purple. I made the circle come to the front to make it look like a flower. Using the text tool I added my name in the center. Using the circle tool again I made one small and one big one and then shaped them into a leaf (kind of), I used the pencil tool to detail them. It did not turn out that great for a first time to be honest but I did try.

* Right-click on your svg image file, select "properties" and report the file size and what application it "opens with." What application might be more appropriate and why (click the "change" button for options)

# Conclusion
* Summarize what you learned here

In this lab I learned a lot about graphics and how they relate to file compression. I really had no idea what all of the differences between image files were and it was interesting to learn when JPG, PNG, or GIF files are useful and what sets them apart from each other. I especially found it interesting to go in depth about the windows operating system, I have never explored that part of the OS before. The logo image creating was quite interesting as well and I was intrigued to layer the design to create something relatable.
