# Executive Summary
* Talk about what the goal of this lab is !
# Object Oriented Programming

* Pick two related tables from the diagram provided in the "module - SQL" and explain the relationship between them a) which is the primary key? b) which is the foreign key?
* Using W3Schools, try out a a) select statement a) where clause and upload screenshots of the results.
* Explain how SQL injections are a security threat and what can be done to reduce the issue.
# Ethical and Legal Implications of Information Systems
## Code of Ethics
