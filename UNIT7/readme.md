# Executive Summary
* Talk about what the goal of this lab is !

In week 7 of Intro to IT for Computer Programmers the topics we are covering get increasingly more in depth of informational technology. Main topics (as seen as bold headers) include object oriented concepts, basic catgeories for data and structures query languages, and IT/computer ethics. In the object orientation concept we will be looking over the creation of class charts and the what details fit into them (features, actions, etc). Data in this weeks lab covers two main topics: relational data and big data- which will both be looked over in depth with categories within themselves further telling them apart and explaining them. Structured Query Language will also be covered and mildly ties into our cybersecurity lesson from last week and the week before. Another topic in this weeks lab that we will take a deeper look into is ethics concerning computers and networking. An interesting part of this lab will be the explanation of another computer organization and what they do in regards to computer ethics around the world. In short, this week we are going over new topics relating to charting programming, understanding data, cybersecurity, and morality. 

# Object Oriented Programming
* Create a class (using paper and pencil or using the Microsoft whiteboard app) for the following: a) Phone b) House c) Employee
* Identify the features (In the video for the Car class, we identified the properties as Year, Make Model etc)
* Identify the actions (In the video a) for the Car class, we identified the methods as Drive, Park, Start etc)
* Then upload a screenshot of your diagram to github for each of the above classes.

# Data, Information and Knowledge
## Relational Data
* What is the difference between data, information and knowledge?

Data are the bits of information that generally do not have a set context. Data can be quantitative- numeric, can be measurements or amounts- or qualitative- characteristic, can be features of descriptions. An example of quantitative data could be: 13 inches by 12 inches (there is no context) and an example of quantitative data could be: grey and fluffy.
Information is basically data but with context. For example, using our quantitative data example one could transform that into quantitative information by saying: The box to pack the headset is 13 inches by 12 inches. To convert out qualitative data example to qualitative information we could say: The little bunny was grey and fluffy. As you can see, information is applied data. 
Knowledge defined simply is the grouping of bundles of information which makes one informed on a topic. Knowledge can help people in conversation, decision making, or even the scientific process. For example, knowledge regarding our quantitative/qualitative information could go as follows if we were given more: The box to pack the headset is 13 inches by 12 inches, the box is made out of blue cardboard with a grey fluffy bunny on the front, and has a detailed explanation of the headset on the back. With all of this information one is knowledgeable of the box that the headset will be packed in. 

* If you were creating a database for a small company and two tables you identify are customers and orders explain the following: (be sure to use the example in the chapter as a guide - customers and orders would be like clubs and events) 
a) What would be the primary key in the customers and orders table?

In the customers and orders tables a good primary key would be the specific customer ID that is associated with the buyer. This ID key as a primary key will allow other information in the table to be changed without actually having to delete the account. For example, although not directly related to IT, when one goes to buy cold cut meat at a supermarket they grab a piece of paper that has a number unique to them. The customers are then called up by that number to pick up their associated order, which is also organized by that customers number. Having an ID for each customer will allow for an easy search with no mixups of first or last names since many can be the same, especially if the customer ID is the primary key on the orders table as well. This will let the seller take a quick glance at the first columns of orders to find the associated phone number, email, mailing address, etc, of the buyer from the buyers table. This is what I would personally choose since it makes it quite easy: If you see the customer ID on the customers table and want to know their order history all you have to do is find the same customer ID on the orders table. The other way around, if you see an order that has a mistake or is out of stock and you need to get more information on the customer all you would need to do is fine that same customer ID on the customers table. 

b) How would the customers and orders table be related?

The customers and orders table would be related because both would have the customer ID to connect the two's data/information. The orders table will allow one to relate multiple orders to a single customer. For example, the customers table will have one customer ID with the associated personal information, then the orders table would be multiple orders (if there are any) with one associated customer ID.

c) What would be the foreign key in the orders table?

The foreign key in the orders table would be the customer ID from the customers table. The foreign key relates the primary key of the main table to the second tabl.e (in this case customers and orders).

d) The orders table would likely have a date field. Explain why it is important to properly define the data type of a field.

The orders table 
# Big Data
* Briefly describe the four "Vs" of big data
* What types of technology have driven the increased need for big data?
# Structured Query Language (SQL)
* Explain RDBMS and how it relates to SQL and the purpose of SQL
* Pick two related tables from the diagram provided in the "module - SQL" and explain the relationship between them a) which is the primary key? b) which is the foreign key?
* Using W3Schools, try out a a) select statement a) where clause and upload screenshots of the results.
* Explain how SQL injections are a security threat and what can be done to reduce the issue.
# Ethical and Legal Implications of Information Systems
## Code of Ethics
* Explain the purpose of a "code of ethics" and why the ACM created a code for the computing discipline.
* Explain the difference between a code of ethics and AUP (acceptable use policies.)
* Pick a site of your choice and read the AUP. Select a policy of interest and report your findings (include a link to the site in your report.)
# Intellectual Property
* From the chapter follow the link to the WIPO. What is the purpose and importance of the WIPO?
* Using links in the chapter explain how a copyright is obtained and the benefit of registering for a copyright with the US Copyright Office. Explain why it might be important to copyright the svg image you created.
* If the svg image you created became an item that identifies a source of goods or services, explain the role of a trademark in defining the intellectual property.
# Information Collection
* Explain how COPPA, FERPA and HIPPA restrict the collection of information on the Internet.
# Conclusion
* Include what you have learnt from this lab
