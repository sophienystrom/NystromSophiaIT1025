# Executive Summary
* Explain the goal for this lab


# LucidChart
Create a new blank diagram (ignore message boxes to upgrade) and create a flowchart for a computer program that asks for a number and then 

* prints "Big" if the number is greater than 10
* prints "Small" if the number is less than 10. Use the following resource (or one of your choice) as a guide: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/programming_methodologies/programming_methodologies_flowchart_elements.htm Add a textbox to the chart with your name
* Download your chart as a jpg file and name it: DecisionFlowchart and upload the file to your GitHub lab folder

* Share your experience using Lucidchart in a paragraph (3-4 lines)



#Networking
##Intro to Networking
Data Transmission

Match the following words with their definitions

Words: Packet Packet-Switching IP Address DNS Protocol

Definitions to match: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate Unit of data Unique identifying number Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address Directory of IP address common names. (For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com)



## Network Hardware
* Explain the benefit of a switch over a hub.


* Explain the benefit of a router over hubs and switches.


## Network Topology
* Explain: Single point of failure and the topologies that experience this issue.


* Compare the Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh. Which do you think is better and why?


# Cybersecurity and Encryption
* Imagine you are part of the Amazon.com online chat. Explain how each component of the security triad would impact your job


* Identify three daily tasks that require authentication. Explain how each one could be converted to multi-factor authentication


* Explain ACL and RBAC. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?


* Explain the interaction of ciphertext, a public key and a private key


* Explain why we need public key cryptography.


## Cryptography
* Type a message in the "Caesar Cipher Exploration box and turn the wheel to encrypt your message. Then explain the encryption here:

* Type a message in the "Frequency Fingerprint Exploration" box and a) Explain the result. b) Would it be different for different languages?

* What is a "Polyalphabetic cipher?" Type a message in the "Polyalphabetic Exploration" box as well as a shift word. Explain the result.

# Brute Force
* What is Brute-Force and how does it relate to Kerckhoffs's principle?


# Conclusion
* Summarize how this lab was useful to you and what you learnt that really interested you!
