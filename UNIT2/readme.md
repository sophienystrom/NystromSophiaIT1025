# Executive Summary
* Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab

# Hardware
## Hard Drives and Memory
* What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive?
* How a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive?
* Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster?
* What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths?
## ALU and Control Unit
* Explain the interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU
## CPU, Input and Output
* Identify how the example addresses each of the components: CPU, Input and Output
## Logic Gates and circuits
* Explain what is meant by a truth table and apply your knowledge to a NAND gate.
* How does the NAND gate truth table compare to that of an AND gate?
## IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
* Explain the purpose of IEEE and the importance of ethics in device design
# Data Representation
## Numeric Conversions
* Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers
* Convert the decimal number 211 to binary showing your work (be sure to include your name in your screenshot or scanned file) and save to a file named DecimalConversion and upload to your lab folder.
## Hexadecimal color representation
* Convert the binary representation: 10110101 to decimal and save your work to a file named BinaryConversion and upload to the lab folder.
* Explain the representation: #ab00ff using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/
* When considering accessibility in web sites would this color be problematic? Explain what should be considered.
# Conclusion
* Explain what you learnt from this lab
